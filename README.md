# BurnStackPoker
A new type of poker game I am brainstorming on.

1. Each player is dealt their 'stack' of cards instead of betting chips.
2. On each player's turn they can 'burn' their stack or bet from their stack.
3. Burning is done by drawing from their stack and making a larger, better hand.
4. Betting is done by placing the top of your 'stack' of face down cards into the pot as a currency of sorts.
5. Standard card game rules apply, except larger hands than normal when 'burning' your 'stack'.
6. Current demo is at https://replit.com/@davidjdews/BurnStackPoker?v=1
